### Types of Knapsack Problem:
The knapsack problem can be classified into the following types:

1. Fractional Knapsack Problem
2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem
3. Bounded Knapsack Problem
4. Unbounded Knapsack Problem

#### - Fractional Knapsack Problem
Given the weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of the knapsack.

#### -0/1 Knapsack Problem
We are given N items where each item has some weight (wi) and value (vi) associated with it. We are also given a bag with capacity W. The target is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of values associated with them is the maximum possible.
Note that here we can either put an item completely into the bag or cannot put it at all.

#### -Bounded Knapsack
Given N items, each item having a given weight wi and a value vi, the task is to maximize the value by selecting a maximum of K items adding up to a maximum weight W.

#### -Unbounded Knapsack Problem
Given a knapsack weight W and a set of N items with certain value vi and weight wi, we need to calculate the maximum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from 0/1 Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use an unlimited number of instances of an item.
